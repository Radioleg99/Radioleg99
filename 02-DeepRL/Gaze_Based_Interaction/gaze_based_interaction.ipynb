        "\n",
        "Some cognitive models describe behaviour and others predict it. Models that predict behaviour must be capable of generating output without that output being part of the input. In this notebook we demonstrate this property for a model of eye movements. The model is a reinforcement learner that is trained by performing hundreds of thousands of simulated eye movements in search of a target of varying size and distance. The model predicts how many eye movements people will tend to make to find a target of a given size and distance. It predicts inhibition of return. It **predicts** Fitts's Law like behaviour and it predicts that the first eye movement will usually undershoot, rather than overshoot the target.\n",

        "Gaze-based interaction is a mode of interaction in which users, including users with a range of movement disabilities, are able to indicate which display item they wish to select by fixating their eyes on it. Confirmation of selection is then made with one of a number of methods, including with a key press, or by holding the fixation for an extended duration of time. The model performs this task for targets with randomly selected location and size.\n",

Humans are known to integrate these estimates into a single integrated representation of the location.

        "- The cognitive model that we have described above accurately predicts human gaze-based interaction performance (Chen et al., 2021).\n",
        "- It is an example of a **computationally rational** cognitive model. This is because the behaviour is predicted from an approximately optimal policy given hypothesised bounds on cognition.\n",
        "- It should be possible to find an approximately optimal policy using any reinforcement learning algorithm.  The only difference that the algorithm will make is to the efficiency with which solution is found.\n",
        "- The separation of cognitive theory and reinforcement learning algorithm is achieved through the statement of the architecture as what is known as a belief-state Markov Decision Process (a **belief-state MDP**), which is a type of Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP).\n",
        "- Using reinforcement learning (RL) to model cognition with the approximately optimal policy contrast does not model the human learning process. For work that does use RL to model human learning see Daw and Dayan (2008).\n",
        "- A number of CHI papers have made use of this architecture. See Oulasvirta et al., 2022 for a review.\n",
        "- An important issue concerns how model parameters are fitted to data. See Keuralinen et al., 2023."
